## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Tokenizer and parser implementation scope for Profile v1

`ArchLinterNet.CEL`'s tokenizer and parser (internal `ArchLinterNet.CEL.Parsing` namespace) SHALL
implement exactly the following lexical and syntactic scope for Profile v1, in addition to the
precedence, associativity, and operator/type/function requirements already fixed elsewhere in
this spec:

- Numeric literals SHALL NOT include a sign; `-` SHALL always tokenize as a standalone operator
  token. A leading `-` before a numeric literal SHALL be reported as `UnsupportedFeature`
  (arithmetic/unary-minus is deferred), never accepted as part of the literal. A float literal
  (`FLOAT_LIT`) whose decimal value cannot be represented as a finite IEEE 754 double (i.e. whose
  magnitude, typically from an extreme exponent, would round to positive or negative infinity)
  SHALL be reported as `SyntaxError` — Profile v1's `Float` type is a finite representable value
  (see the value-types requirement), so a literal that cannot be represented as one SHALL NOT be
  silently accepted as `Infinity`.
- The tokenizer SHALL accept `null` literals, `u`/`U`-suffixed unsigned-integer literals, and
  `b"..."`/`B"..."` byte-string literals as valid tokens (they are normative CEL syntax), and the
  parser SHALL reject each with `UnsupportedFeature` at the point the grammar would otherwise
  accept it — never `SyntaxError`. The same applies to the arithmetic operators (`+ - * / %`) and
  the conditional operator (`? :`) when encountered in an expression-forming position.
  A malformed instance of any of these tokens (e.g. an unterminated byte-string) SHALL still be
  reported as `SyntaxError`, since it is not valid CEL syntax to begin with.
- String literals SHALL support `'...'` and `"..."` quoting with the escape sequences
  `\n \t \r \\ \' \" \` \? \a \b \f \v`, `\xHH`, `\uHHHH`, and `\UHHHHHHHH`, plus `r"..."` /
  `R"..."` raw-string quoting (no escape processing) and a well-formed three-digit octal escape
  (`\NNN`, each `N` an octal digit, decoding a byte value in the `\000`-`\377` range — the same
  range and decode model as `\xHH`). A well-formed octal escape is valid CEL syntax that Profile
  v1 defers: a plain (non-byte) string literal containing one SHALL tokenize successfully and the
  parser SHALL reject it with `UnsupportedFeature`, never `SyntaxError`, consistent with the
  `null`/`uint`/byte-string literal precedent — a byte-string literal needs no such reclassification
  since it is already always deferred regardless of content. A malformed octal escape (not exactly
  three octal digits, or a value beyond `\377`) SHALL be reported as `SyntaxError`. CEL has no
  standalone `\0` escape — a lone `\0` not followed by two more octal digits is a malformed
  (incomplete) octal escape, not a special NUL form, and SHALL be rejected as such rather than
  silently treated as NUL. `\uHHHH` and `\UHHHHHHHH` SHALL both reject a codepoint in the UTF-16
  surrogate range (`0xD800`-`0xDFFF`) — neither is a valid standalone Unicode scalar value. An
  unterminated string literal or a malformed escape sequence SHALL be reported as `SyntaxError`.
  The tokenizer SHALL accept a well-formed triple-quoted string literal (`'''...'''`/`"""..."""`,
  with or without an `r`/`R`/`b`/`B` prefix) as a single valid token — mirroring `null`/`u`-suffixed
  unsigned-integer/byte-string literals above — rather than silently re-tokenizing it as a sequence
  of shorter single/double-quoted string literals (which would produce a misleading diagnostic at
  the wrong source location instead of naming the actual construct). The parser SHALL reject a
  well-formed triple-quoted string literal token with `UnsupportedFeature` (triple-quoted-string
  lexing beyond well-formedness validation is out of scope for Profile v1 and reserved for a future
  profile version), never `SyntaxError`, consistent with the `null`/`uint`/byte-string literal
  precedent. Well-formedness for a raw (`r`/`R`-prefixed) triple-quoted literal means the tokenizer
  located a matching closing triple-quote before the end of input, treating a backslash as an
  ordinary content character with no special meaning — exactly as raw single/double-quoted string
  literals already do — so a backslash immediately preceding what would otherwise be the closer
  SHALL NOT prevent it from being recognized as the closer. Well-formedness for a non-raw
  triple-quoted literal means the tokenizer located a matching closing triple-quote before the end
  of input AND every escape sequence encountered along the way is itself a valid CEL escape
  sequence per this same requirement (reusing the identical escape-validation grammar single/
  double-quoted string literals use, including the well-formed-octal-escape case above) — an
  escaped quote character (e.g. `\'` inside a `'''`-quoted literal) SHALL NOT be mistaken for
  (part of) the closer, and an invalid escape sequence (e.g. `\q`) SHALL be reported as
  `SyntaxError` exactly as it would be inside a single/double-quoted literal, not silently accepted
  as part of a "well-formed" deferred construct. A triple-quoted string (raw or non-raw) with no
  matching closer before the end of input, or a non-raw one containing an invalid escape sequence,
  SHALL be reported as `SyntaxError`, since it is not valid CEL syntax to begin with — only a
  fully-formed triple-quoted literal is deferred, matching this spec's general
  fully-formed-vs-dangling deferred-construct rule below.
- Identifiers SHALL be restricted to the pinned grammar's ASCII `IDENT`/`SELECTOR` alphabet
  (`[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*`); a non-ASCII letter (e.g. `é`) is not part of any identifier and
  SHALL be reported as `SyntaxError`, not silently accepted as a Unicode identifier character.
  Numeric literals follow the same ASCII-digit restriction (`[0-9]`), and a decimal point SHALL
  only be consumed as part of a `FLOAT_LIT` when followed by at least one digit — `3.` alone is
  not a valid float literal and SHALL tokenize as an `IntLiteral` followed by a separate `.`.
- `SELECTOR ("." SELECTOR)* "{" ... "}"` (message/proto literal construction — every segment,
  including the first, is `SELECTOR`-governed, not `IDENT`-governed; see the reserved-word bullet
  below) and a leading `.` before an identifier (root/absolute-qualified name syntax, e.g.
  `.pkg.Type`) are both valid CEL primary
  forms under the pinned grammar; Profile v1 defers both, so the parser SHALL report
  `UnsupportedFeature` for each — never `SyntaxError` — at the point the grammar would otherwise
  accept them, and this SHALL hold regardless of nesting position (e.g. inside call arguments,
  parenthesized sub-expressions, or index expressions), not only at the top level of the
  expression being compiled. A `"{" ... "}"` immediately following an expression SHALL only be
  classified as a message literal when that expression is itself a qualified-name shape (an
  identifier, or a chain of pure member accesses rooted in one) — a call result, index result, or
  literal is never a valid message-literal receiver under the pinned grammar, so e.g. `1{}` SHALL
  be `SyntaxError`, not `UnsupportedFeature`.
- A deferred construct (arithmetic, the conditional operator, a list/map/message literal, a
  root-qualified name, a triple-quoted string literal, a plain string literal containing a
  well-formed octal escape) SHALL only be classified as `UnsupportedFeature` after the parser has
  verified its own syntax is complete and well-formed under the pinned grammar; a dangling or
  incomplete instance (e.g. `a +` with no right-hand operand, `a ? b` with no `:` and false
  branch, a bare `.` with no following identifier, an unterminated `[`/`{`, an unterminated
  triple-quoted string, or a malformed octal escape) SHALL be `SyntaxError`, since it is not valid
  CEL syntax to begin with — only a fully-formed but deferred construct is `UnsupportedFeature`.
  This validation SHALL follow the pinned grammar's actual sub-structure, not
  a simplified approximation: the conditional operator's true branch is
  `ConditionalOr` precedence (an unparenthesized nested ternary there is `SyntaxError`, not
  `UnsupportedFeature`) while its false branch is the full recursive `Expr` (an unparenthesized
  nested ternary there is valid and SHALL also be fully validated); deferred arithmetic SHALL be
  absorbed at the `Relation = Addition [Relop Addition]` grammar level — i.e. as part of parsing
  each comparison operand — rather than only recognized as a flat trailer once a fully-reduced
  `ConditionalOr` has already returned, so arithmetic combined with a comparison anywhere in the
  expression (e.g. `a + b == c`, or nested inside a ternary branch as in `a ? b + c == d : e`) is
  classified correctly instead of producing a spurious `SyntaxError` about a missing `:`/`)`; a
  message literal's field keys (`SELECTOR ("." SELECTOR)* "{" field ":" value ...  "}"`) SHALL be bare
  identifiers, never an arbitrary expression — `Type{1: 2}` and `Type{'field': 1}` are
  `SyntaxError`, unlike a standalone map literal (`{1: 2}`) whose keys are arbitrary expressions
  and remains `UnsupportedFeature`; this bare-identifier-field-key requirement SHALL apply
  identically when the message-literal receiver is a root-qualified name (e.g.
  `.pkg.Type{1: 2}` SHALL be `SyntaxError` for the same reason `Type{1: 2}` is, not bypass field
  validation by virtue of being root-qualified). Message-literal-receiver eligibility SHALL be
  determined by parse state (whether the immediately preceding syntax was a qualified-name
  chain with no intervening call, index, or parenthesization), not by the shape of the resulting
  internal syntax node alone — a parenthesized qualified name (e.g. `(Type)`, `(pkg.Type)`) is
  syntactically indistinguishable in shape from an unparenthesized one once parsed, but per the
  pinned grammar the qualified-name prefix of a message literal is a primary-level production,
  not a generic postfix step usable after any expression that happens to evaluate to an
  identifier shape; `(Type){field: 1}` SHALL therefore be `SyntaxError`, even though
  `Type{field: 1}` is `UnsupportedFeature`.
- A root-qualified name (a leading `.` before an identifier) SHALL only consume its own leading
  `"." IDENT` (plus an immediately following call, e.g. `.f(...)`, mirroring a non-root-qualified
  free function call); any further `.member`, `.call(...)`, `[index]`, or message-literal step
  SHALL be handled by the same parsing path used for a non-root-qualified identifier chain, not a
  separate bespoke path — so `.pkg.f()` (root-qualified receiver call) and `.pkg.Type{field: 1}`
  (root-qualified message literal) parse completely instead of leaving a trailing `(`/`{`
  unconsumed, and every `.member`/`[index]` step in a root-qualified chain after the leading one
  is bounded by `MaxNestingDepth` through the same mechanism a non-root-qualified chain uses.
- A reserved identifier (see the existing `IDENT = SELECTOR - RESERVED` / `SELECTOR =
  identifier-regex - KEYWORD` distinction) that begins a primary expression is only valid as the
  root of a `SELECTOR ("." SELECTOR)*` chain that ITSELF terminates in a message literal
  (`"{" fieldInits "}"`) — a reserved root is never a valid plain qualified-name reference, call
  target, or index target on its own. This is a whole-chain requirement, not satisfied merely by
  the token immediately following the reserved root being `.`: the parser SHALL track this as
  pending state through the entire chain (every `.member` step the chain passes through, however
  many segments), resolving it only once the chain is known to have ended — satisfied the moment
  a message literal (`{...}`) is actually reached anywhere in the chain, and reported as
  `SyntaxError` if the chain instead ends via a call, an index, or simply no further tokens, with
  no message literal ever reached. This rule applies identically whether the reserved identifier
  is root-qualified or not: `package{field: 1}`, `package.Type{field: 1}`,
  `package.Type.Other{field: 1}`, and `.package{field: 1}` SHALL all be `UnsupportedFeature`
  (valid, deferred qualified-name/message-literal syntax), while `package()`, `package.Type`,
  `package.Type()`, `package.Type[0]`, `.package`, `.package()`, and `.package.Type` SHALL all be
  `SyntaxError` (a reserved word can never be a callable name, an index target, or a bare/plain
  qualified-name reference, root-qualified or not, unless the chain it roots eventually reaches a
  message literal). A reserved word used as an ordinary member-selector or receiver-call name on a
  non-reserved receiver (e.g. `x.package()`, `x.package`) is unaffected by this rule — it was
  already `SELECTOR`-governed under the existing member-access requirement, and the pending-state
  tracking above only ever originates from a reserved *root* token, never from a reserved word
  reached partway through a chain whose root was not itself reserved.
- The decision to classify an expression as `UnsupportedFeature` (as opposed to allowing parsing
  to continue toward a normal result) SHALL be deferred until the entire top-level expression has
  finished parsing successfully — every enclosing `(`/`[`/`{` matched with its closing
  `)`/`]`/`}`, every ternary's `:` and false branch present, full input consumed. A deferred
  construct's own syntax being valid SHALL NOT cause the parser to stop validating whatever
  encloses it; only the first such classification decision made SHALL be reported (first deferred
  construct encountered, in a diagnostic-stability sense — not necessarily the syntactically
  outermost one).
- A unary prefix chain (`"!" {"!"} Member` or `"-" {"-"} Member`) SHALL repeat only the same
  operator; mixing `!` and `-` in one prefix chain (e.g. `!-x`, `-!x`) has no valid CEL
  interpretation under the pinned grammar and SHALL be `SyntaxError`, not `UnsupportedFeature`.
- A reserved identifier (`as`, `break`, `const`, `continue`, `else`, `for`, `function`, `if`,
  `import`, `let`, `loop`, `package`, `namespace`, `return`, `var`, `void`, `while`) used as a bare
  primary expression reference SHALL be `SyntaxError`; the same word used in member-selector
  position (after `.`, as a member name or call name) SHALL parse successfully, per this spec's
  existing `IDENT = SELECTOR - RESERVED` / `SELECTOR = identifier-regex - KEYWORD` distinction —
  whether it resolves is compile-time binder territory (#326), not a parser concern.
- Free-function call syntax (`IDENT "(" args ")"` with no receiver) SHALL parse successfully even
  though Profile v1's function catalog declares no free functions; resolving whether the name is
  a known function is compile-time binder territory (#326), consistent with this spec's existing
  "calling an unknown function name is a compile-time `BindingError`" note.
- The tokenizer's whitespace token SHALL be restricted to exactly tab, newline, form-feed,
  carriage return, and space, matching the pinned grammar — not the broader .NET
  `char.IsWhiteSpace()` category, which also accepts non-ASCII Unicode space separators (e.g.
  U+00A0 NBSP) and other whitespace-category characters (e.g. U+000B vertical tab) the grammar
  does not include; such a character SHALL be reported as `SyntaxError`.
- An unescaped carriage return (`\r`), like an unescaped newline (`\n`), SHALL terminate a
  single/double-quoted or raw string literal with `SyntaxError` rather than being silently
  absorbed into the string's content.
- The tokenizer SHALL recognize the combined byte-plus-raw string prefix (`br"..."`/`Br"..."`/
  `bR"..."`/`BR"..."`, byte marker first per `BYTES_LIT : ("b"|"B") STRING_LIT` /
  `STRING_LIT : ["r"|"R"] STRING`), not only the single-marker forms. `\x`/`\X` (byte-value
  escapes) SHALL both be accepted as equivalent, and `\u` (4-digit Unicode escape) SHALL be
  accepted inside a byte-string literal exactly as in a string literal; only `\U` (8-digit
  Unicode escape) SHALL be rejected inside a byte-string literal — the pinned grammar's
  byte-string escape set includes `\u` but not `\U`.
- `MaxLiteralSize` SHALL bound element/entry count during list/map/message-literal syntax
  validation (each parsed element or `key : value` entry counted as it is validated), matching its
  documented "element count for list/map literals" contract, in addition to the already-enforced
  string/byte-string content-length bound. A triple-quoted string literal's decoded content
  length SHALL be bounded by the same `MaxLiteralSize` limit, uniformly with every other literal
  kind that carries decoded content — never by raw token text length (which would inconsistently
  penalize delimiters and prefixes the decoded content itself does not carry).
- The parser SHALL enforce `MaxNestingDepth` against every postfix member-access (`.selector`) or
  indexing (`[...]`) step in a chain, not only against recursive constructs like parenthesized
  sub-expressions — the public `MaxNestingDepth` documentation explicitly lists "member access
  chains" as bounded by this limit.
- The parser SHALL enforce `MaxIdentifierCount` by counting each distinct identifier reference
  (a bare variable reference, a function name in a call, or a member-selector name) as it is
  consumed, producing `BudgetExceeded` the moment the count is exceeded — this is a purely
  syntactic count requiring no binder/schema information, so #325 enforces it directly rather than
  deferring it to #326's binder pass.
- On the first syntax error, unsupported-feature condition, or structural-limit violation, parsing
  SHALL stop and return exactly that one diagnostic (fail-fast, no error recovery).
- Every diagnostic produced by the tokenizer or parser SHALL use diagnostic category `"parser"`
  and SHALL carry `profileId` in `Parameters`, consistent with this spec's blanket diagnostic
  requirement. `BudgetExceeded` diagnostics from the tokenizer/parser SHALL additionally carry
  `limitName` and `observedValue`, matching the existing `MaxExpressionLength` `BudgetExceeded`
  parameter shape.

#### Scenario: Negative numeric literal is reported as a deferred feature, not accepted

  deferred in Profile v1)

#### Scenario: Deferred arithmetic operator is distinguished from invented syntax

- **WHEN** the expression `a + b` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with an `UnsupportedFeature` diagnostic, not `SyntaxError`

#### Scenario: Invented operator syntax is a syntax error

- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: Deferred arithmetic is detected regardless of nesting position

- **WHEN** the expression `f(a + b)` (arithmetic inside a call argument) is parsed

  about an unexpected closing token

#### Scenario: A non-ASCII letter is rejected, not absorbed into an identifier

- **WHEN** the expression `é` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: A decimal point with no following digit does not form a float literal

- **WHEN** the source `3.` is tokenized
- **THEN** it produces an `IntLiteral` token for `3` followed by a separate `.` (`Dot`) token, not
  a single `FloatLiteral` token

#### Scenario: A float literal whose magnitude cannot be represented is a syntax error, not Infinity

- **WHEN** the source `1.99e90000009` (an exponent far beyond IEEE 754 double's range) is tokenized
- **THEN** tokenization fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic
- **AND** no `FloatLiteral` token carrying `double.PositiveInfinity` is produced

- **WHEN** the expression `Type{field: 1}` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with an `UnsupportedFeature` diagnostic, not `SyntaxError`

#### Scenario: Root-qualified name syntax is deferred, not a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `.pkg.Type` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with an `UnsupportedFeature` diagnostic, not `SyntaxError`

#### Scenario: A standalone \0 escape is a malformed octal escape, not a syntax error from an unknown escape

- **WHEN** the string literal `'\0'` is tokenized
- **THEN** tokenization fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic (a lone `\0` is an incomplete
  three-digit octal escape, not treated as NUL)

#### Scenario: A well-formed octal escape is deferred, not a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `'\012'` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with an `UnsupportedFeature` diagnostic, not `SyntaxError`
- **AND** `diagnostic.Parameters["feature"]` equals `"octal-escape"`

#### Scenario: A malformed octal escape is a syntax error, not an unsupported feature

- **WHEN** the same check is repeated for `"""hello"""`, `r'''hello'''`, `b"""hello"""`, and
  `br'''hello'''`
- **THEN** each fails with the same `UnsupportedFeature` diagnostic, not `SyntaxError`

#### Scenario: A triple-quoted string literal tokenizes as one construct, not re-tokenized as shorter literals

- **WHEN** `'''hello'''` is tokenized
- **THEN** it produces a single `TripleQuotedStringLiteral` token spanning the entire input
- **AND** the tokenizer does NOT succeed by re-interpreting the input as three adjacent
  single-quoted string literals (`''`, `'hello'`, `''`)

- **WHEN** the expression `'''unterminated` (no matching closing `'''`) is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic, not `UnsupportedFeature`

#### Scenario: An escaped quote character inside a triple-quoted string does not falsely end the scan

- **WHEN** the source `'''a\'''b'''` is tokenized (an escaped `'` immediately followed by two more
  `'` characters partway through the content)
- **THEN** it produces a single `TripleQuotedStringLiteral` token spanning the entire input, not a
  token ending at the escaped sequence

#### Scenario: A raw triple-quoted string's backslash has no special meaning

- **WHEN** the source `r'''a\'''` is tokenized (a raw triple-quoted literal ending in a backslash
  immediately followed by the closing `'''`)

  backslash is an ordinary content character, not an escape marker, so it does NOT prevent the
  following `'''` from being recognized as the closer

#### Scenario: A non-raw triple-quoted string with an invalid escape sequence is a syntax error

- **WHEN** the source `'''\q'''` is tokenized (`\q` is not a valid CEL escape sequence)
- **THEN** tokenization fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic — escape-sequence validity is
  checked exactly as it is for a single/double-quoted literal, not skipped merely because the
  overall construct will end up deferred

#### Scenario: A surrogate-range \u escape is rejected

- **WHEN** the string literal `'\uD800'` is tokenized
- **THEN** tokenization fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: Reserved identifier is rejected as a bare reference but accepted as a member name

- **WHEN** the expression `if == true` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic
- **WHEN** the expression `x.if` is parsed against a schema declaring variable `x`
- **THEN** the expression parses successfully (member-selector position is valid; whether `if`
  resolves against `x`'s schema is a binder concern)

#### Scenario: Unterminated string literal is a syntax error, not an unsupported feature

- **WHEN** the expression `'unterminated` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: Every parser diagnostic carries the parser category and profile identifier

- **WHEN** any tokenizer or parser diagnostic is produced
- **THEN** `diagnostic.Category` equals `"parser"`
- **AND** `diagnostic.Parameters["profileId"]` equals `"arch-linter/cel/v1"`

- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic, not `UnsupportedFeature`

#### Scenario: A message literal on a non-qualified-name receiver is a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `1{}` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic, not `UnsupportedFeature` (an integer
  literal is never a valid message-literal receiver)

#### Scenario: MaxIdentifierCount is enforced by the parser

- **WHEN** `CelCompilationLimits.MaxIdentifierCount` is `1` and the expression `a || b` (two
  identifier references) is parsed

  `limitName = "MaxIdentifierCount"`

#### Scenario: MaxNestingDepth is enforced against a member-access chain

- **WHEN** `CelCompilationLimits.MaxNestingDepth` is exceeded by the length of a non-parenthesized
  member-access chain (e.g. `a.b.c.d.e`)
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `BudgetExceeded` diagnostic carrying
  `limitName = "MaxNestingDepth"`

#### Scenario: A non-ASCII whitespace character is rejected

- **WHEN** the expression `true` followed by U+00A0 (NBSP) followed by `== false` is tokenized
- **THEN** tokenization fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: An unescaped carriage return inside a string literal is rejected

- **WHEN** the string literal `'a` followed by an unescaped carriage return followed by `b'` is
  tokenized
- **THEN** tokenization fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: A ternary's true branch containing arithmetic is fully validated, not misreported as a missing colon

#### Scenario: Arithmetic inside a comparison operand is deferred, not a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `a + b == c` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with an `UnsupportedFeature` diagnostic

#### Scenario: An unterminated parenthesized sub-expression containing arithmetic is a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `(a + b` (missing closing paren) is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic, not `UnsupportedFeature` — the
  missing `)` SHALL be caught before the deferred-arithmetic classification is ever considered

#### Scenario: A parenthesized member-access chain is not a message-literal receiver

- **WHEN** the expression `(pkg.Type){field: 1}` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic, not `UnsupportedFeature`

#### Scenario: A root-qualified free function call parses completely

- **WHEN** the expression `.f()` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with an `UnsupportedFeature` diagnostic (not a `SyntaxError` about
  trailing input), since the call is fully consumed

#### Scenario: A root-qualified receiver call parses completely

- **WHEN** the expression `.pkg.f()` is parsed

  trailing input)

  member-access chain (e.g. `.a.b.c.d.e`)
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `BudgetExceeded` diagnostic carrying

- **WHEN** the expression `x.package()` is parsed
- **THEN** it parses successfully as a receiver call named `package` on `x`

#### Scenario: A reserved-word-rooted chain with no message literal anywhere is a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `package.Type` (no trailing `{...}`) is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic — a `.` immediately following the
  reserved root is not by itself sufficient; the chain must actually reach a message literal

#### Scenario: A reserved-word-rooted chain ending in a call is a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `package.Type()` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: A reserved-word-rooted chain ending in an index is a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `package.Type[0]` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: A root-qualified reserved-word-rooted chain with no message literal is a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `.package.Type` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: A root-qualified reserved-word-rooted chain ending in a call is a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `.package.Type()` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: A reserved-word-rooted chain reaching a message literal through multiple segments is deferred

- **WHEN** the expression `package.Type.Other{field: 1}` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with an `UnsupportedFeature` diagnostic, not `SyntaxError`

#### Scenario: A message literal field key must be a bare identifier

- **WHEN** the expression `Type{1: 2}` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic, not `UnsupportedFeature`

#### Scenario: A map literal key may be an arbitrary expression

- **WHEN** the expression `{1: 2}` (standalone brace, no qualified-name receiver) is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with an `UnsupportedFeature` diagnostic (still deferred, just not a
  syntax error)

#### Scenario: Mixing '!' and '-' in a unary prefix chain is a syntax error

- **WHEN** the expression `!-x` is parsed
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic, not `UnsupportedFeature`

#### Scenario: A combined byte-and-raw string prefix is recognized

- **WHEN** the source `br'a\nb'` is tokenized
- **THEN** it produces a single `BytesLiteral` token whose decoded value is the four raw
  characters `a`, `\`, `n`, `b` (escapes are not processed)

#### Scenario: A 4-digit Unicode escape inside a byte-string literal is accepted

- **WHEN** the byte-string literal `b'A'` is tokenized
- **THEN** it produces a `BytesLiteral` token whose decoded value is `"A"`

#### Scenario: An 8-digit Unicode escape inside a byte-string literal is rejected

- **WHEN** the byte-string literal `b'\U00000041'` is tokenized
- **THEN** tokenization fails with a `SyntaxError` diagnostic

#### Scenario: A byte-string literal's octal escape decodes normally without a separate deferred kind

- **WHEN** the byte-string literal `b'\101'` is tokenized
- **THEN** it produces a `BytesLiteral` token whose decoded value is `"A"` — no separate deferred
  token kind is needed since a byte-string literal is already always deferred regardless of content

#### Scenario: MaxLiteralSize bounds list-literal element count during validation

- **WHEN** `CelCompilationLimits.MaxLiteralSize` is exceeded by the number of elements in a list
  literal being validated (e.g. `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` against a limit of `3`)
- **THEN** compilation fails with a `BudgetExceeded` diagnostic carrying
  `limitName = "MaxLiteralSize"`

#### Scenario: MaxLiteralSize bounds a triple-quoted string literal by decoded content length, not raw token length

- **WHEN** `CelCompilationLimits.MaxLiteralSize` is `1` and the triple-quoted string literal
  `'''a'''` (7 raw characters, 1 character of decoded content) is tokenized
- **THEN** tokenization succeeds — the limit is checked against the decoded content length, not
  the raw token text length that would otherwise inconsistently include the 6 quote characters
